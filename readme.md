Welcome to the `Psychological Round Level Indicator` project! 
  PsyRoundLevel is a custom indicator designed to highlight psychological 
  round price levels on a financial chart. 

These levels, such as 50, 100, 1000, and 10000, often act as natural support 
  or resistance zones due to human trading behavior. 

This indicator visualizes multiple levels with different levels of transparency 
  to indicate their significance.
